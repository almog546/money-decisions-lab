# Money Decisions Lab

Money Decisions Lab is a full-stack web application for tracking and reviewing financial decisions over time.

Instead of judging a decision immediately, users log it with a confidence level and return week later to evaluate whether they would make the same choice again. Over time, this creates clear patterns between confidence, spending, and outcomes.
